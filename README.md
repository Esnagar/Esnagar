### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Esther! 

I'm a multimedia engineer interested in developing unique webs and mobile apps. I'm specialized in front-end and 
UI/UX design, but I also enjoy working on everything related to databases and APIs. I am always aware 
of trends and best practices in order to develop quality products.
